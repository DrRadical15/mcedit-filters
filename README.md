Official speak:

All of the MCEdit Filters created by me, DrRadical15. You may use, modify, and/or redistribute these documents by any means, however, credit must be given to people who I borrowed the code of for the file that you are using, modifying, and/or redistributing as well as myself.

When modifying or redisributing files, you must always share the uncompressed versions if sharing the compressed versions.

In plain English:
-----------------

Acreddit me as well as anyone else I mention in the comments of the filter if sharing my filters. You may edit and share these filters as long as you acreddit the people mentioned in the script.
